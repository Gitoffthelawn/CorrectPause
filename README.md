<h2>Correct Pause</h2>

**Firefox** extension to fix YouTube [Spacebar] issue _(play/pause video after Alt+Tab)_

You can get it here: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/correct-pause/

<br>

<h3>For Chrome users</h3>
I'd also like to publish this extension to Chrome store, but it will cost me $5 (I don't want to pay for fixing their's issues)
<br><br>

You still can run the script from **correctPause.js** by using an extension like [**Tampermonkey**](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo) or others
